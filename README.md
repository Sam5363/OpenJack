# OpenJack
Blackjack for Opencomputers

This program is 100% not the best out there but i wanted to make my own so i did.

This game was designed as a bundle-in game for the NikoDE Desktop Environment so being lightweight was a priority.
You may use this program for whatever its not exclusive in the slightest (if it was why would i post it to git) no credit required.
